Natural language processing areas that we focus on include: Automatic language understanding especially in ungrammatical, fragmented, and short-hand ambiguous utterances Language of electronic health records for improving information access and contributing to better healthcare Understanding consumer-written text, such as electronic petitions describing citizen concerns and social media, for improving public policy Sentiment and opinion analysis to uncover hints of deception and fraud in financial disclosure documents. Real-world domains we tackle include: Health informatics Public health informatics Mental health informatics Computational social science. Not only do we develop novel methods for natural language understanding, but we also work to release data sets and associated tools to help in natural language processing.","title":"About"},{"location":"faq/","text":"Frequently Asked Questions How do I get access to GitHup Project?
